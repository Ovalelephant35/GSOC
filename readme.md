# Google Summer of Code Proposals - 2024

## About

This repository contains my proposals for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024 with Sugar Labs and FreeCAD organizations. GSoC is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open-source projects. These proposals outline my project ideas, plans, and qualifications for participating in GSoC.

## Organization: Sugar Labs

### Project Title: Sugar on Raspberry Pi

#### Proposal Summary

Sugar runs on RPi and we should take advantage of that to reach the Maker community. This project involves ensuring that Sugar runs w/o any issues; that it is packaged in a way that is suiable for inclusion on the Raspberry Pi operating system images. Also, there are any number of Sugar activities that could be enhanced by knowing some of the details of the RPi, such as Turtle Blocks, Measure, and Pippy, all of which could be tailored to take advantage of the sensors available on RPi.

## Organization: FreeCAD

### Project Title: Improve the FreeCad API documentation

#### Proposal Summary

The API documentaiton of FreeCAD is generated with doxygen from the docstrings contained in the source code. It is hosted on https://github.com/FreeCAD/SourceDoc . It is currently not easily readable, the modules structure doesn't list classes and functions, python functionality is not well distinguishable from C++ functionality, and many other problems.
